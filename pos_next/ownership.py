`valid_from` is deliberately NOT here even though `ItemPrice.check_duplicates` treats it as
a discriminator (`item_price.py:99-120`). It carries meta default `'Today'`
(`item_price.json`), so every row Frappe inserts already has a date and no managed row can
ever match an empty-valued predicate on it. Measured: an inserted managed row reads back
`valid_from='2026-08-16'`; adding either `["is", "not set"]` or `["in", [None, ""]]` selects
zero rows, which would make every managed identity look new and then fail in
`check_duplicates`. A future-dated legacy row that some other path marks is caught instead by
the duplicate-identity throw in `PriceGroup._sync_item_prices`.
