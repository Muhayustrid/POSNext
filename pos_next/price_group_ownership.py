"""Ownership constants and field definitions for the Price Group feature.

Ported from the `selling_additional` app. A Price Group owns exactly one generated
Price List (`PG-<name>`), the unscoped Item Price rows on that list, and every POS
Profile of its outlet companies. Ownership is recorded in Custom Fields so a row can
always be traced back to the group that created it — and restored when the group is
disabled or deleted.

a date and no managed row can ever match an empty-valued predicate on it: adding either
`["is", "not set"]` or `["in", [None, ""]]` selects zero rows, which would make every
managed identity look new and then fail in `check_duplicates`. A future-dated legacy row
